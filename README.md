Hello!
This is a CAD project for Hack Club Arcade, my first one actually :))
I wanted to do something FRC-related, so I decided to CAD an elevator from scratch (which is just a combination of all the CAD I've seen from Chief Delphi of all the top teams)

(also not very good at CAD)
used thrifty bot's elevator kit for inspiration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oSjqXBBtoV5E6IUDdsV3zimKVau1XG3m/view
